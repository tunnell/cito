To make the software trigger run quick enough to keep up with high data rates,
parts of the code are written in C to make them fast.

There are essentially two steps to this code, which involves calls to three different functions.  This is `add_samples`, which is used to send occurences to the code.  Then event ranges are found using two function calls to `build_events` and `overlaps`.
